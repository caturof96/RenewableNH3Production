# RenewableNH3Production
This repository hosts the code for calculating the global geospatial costs of ammonia production while considering key factors such as wind and solar resources and water stress. Additionally, it includes algorithms to optimize the distribution and production locations for ammonia, aiming to minimize costs and environmental impact.

We are currently working on uploading and updating the models.
